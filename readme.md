# HexChat

My plan for this fork is to firstly see if I can make it put a newline after each message.. I just like messages a little more spaced out!

If I can get that done then I want to see how hard it might be to include a set of viewport-shaders like the ones available in retrarch or scummvm, I think that would be a really fun feature for an irc client! (could make it look like a real oldschool terminal!!?) Asterisk: I have no idea how hard this might be!
